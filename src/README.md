CLASSES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS:

Game Class
The Game class represents the main logic of your text-based adventure game. It contains methods for loading rooms from a file, managing player actions, handling puzzles, and controlling the flow of the game.

Room Class
The Room class encapsulates the properties of a room in the game. Each room has a unique ID, a name, a description, a list of directions leading to other rooms, a list of items present in the room, and an optional puzzle. Rooms can be marked as visited and puzzles can be marked as solved.

Player Class
The Player class represents the player in the game. It manages the player's inventory, allowing items to be added and removed. The class also provides methods to check if the player has a specific item and displays the items in the player's inventory.

Item Class
The Item class represents an item that can be found in a room or carried by the player. Each item has a name and a description. Items can be picked up, dropped, and inspected by the player.

Puzzle Class
The Puzzle class represents a puzzle that the player can encounter in a room. Puzzles have a name, a description, an answer, and a limited number of attempts allowed to solve them. Players can attempt to solve puzzles by entering answers, and the puzzle keeps track of remaining attempts.

Monster Class
The Monster class represents a monster object that the player can encounter in a room. They can choose to fight or ignore it. Monsters have a name, description, and HP.

MonsterImpl Class
The MonsterImpl class is responsible for creating a Monster object by reading its properties from a file.
